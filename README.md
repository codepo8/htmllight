# HTMLLight

I just discovered this again on an old CD. It is an in-browser HTML editor of sorts I wrote in around 2000 to help my company with some HTML for emails (I think).

The amazing thing is that it still works, and you can try it out in the browser now. 

Looking at the HTML, the JavaScript and CSS I am happy that browsers and standards have come a long way. The JavaScript is atrocious but there were a lot of weird browsers to support :)

I hope you have some fun and feel some happiness about what we can choose from today seeing this :)
