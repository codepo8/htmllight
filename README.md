# HTMLLight

I just discovered this again on an old CD. It is an in-browser HTML editor of sorts I wrote in around 2000 to help my company with some HTML for emails (I think).

The amazing thing is that the editor part still works, and you can [try it out in the browser now](https://codepo8.github.io/htmllight/). 

Here's the mistake I made. The code only checks if `document.all` or `document.layers` is defined, so in today's browser world the changes don't get applied as neither is true any longer. 

Looking at the HTML, the JavaScript and CSS I am happy that browsers and standards have come a long way. The JavaScript is atrocious but there were a lot of weird browsers to support :)

I hope you have some fun and feel some happiness about what we can choose from today seeing this :)
